	<h1>Manos and Maria Business Leadership </h1>
	<p>This is the Business Leadership site for them.</p>

	<p>Who we are. Focus on your background in business and real estate. Don't really talk about Eview but do talk about being thought leaders and the franchising structure that we are known for.</p>

	<p>Podcast</p>

	<p>How we can help. Blog, Postcast, Book - Download, Coachin, Public Speaking. Make it obvious and clear what you can do for them. The purpose of this site is to provide information and to promote yourselves and business leaders and to capture potential YBYB's information.</p>

	<p>Blog</p>

	<p>Don't try to recruit agents directly from this site. Have a Learn More section where you can list all your other businesses and then link them through to the careers pages on those sites.</p>
