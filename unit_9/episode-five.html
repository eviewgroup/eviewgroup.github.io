		<h4>Episode 5 - Julie Anderson</h4>
		<h5>Uploaded - April 9th 2017</h5>
		<br>
		<p>Business success depends on hiring the right people, at the right time with the right competencies. In this weeks episode of 'On The Couch with M &amp; M,' Manos interviews Julie Anderson, head of Eview Group's HR &amp; Recruitment department.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Managing Human Resources is a specialist field requiring expert knowledge of employment legislation, recruitment methodologies and performance development. In this interview, Julie breaks down the minimum obligations a business has in the remuneration of team members, which awards apply and what compulsory allowances &amp; entitlements sales agent employees are legally meant to receive; the difference between salary packages &amp; the truth around 'commission only' arrangements.</p>
