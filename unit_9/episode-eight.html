		<h4>Episode 8 - Work Life Balance</h4>
		<h5>Uploaded - April 30th 2017</h5>
		<br>
		<p>The dynamic world of real estate is often an environment of what we call ‘organised chaos.’ It is not a nine to five occupation; real estate is a lifestyle choice. In this episode, Manos &amp; Maria discuss and share some simple habits, techniques and tools they use in their business to achieve that elusive ‘work life balance.’ They share insights on how they work as a husband and wife team and how they balance their work and personal commitments around their family needs.</p>
