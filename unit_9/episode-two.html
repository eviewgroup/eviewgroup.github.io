		<h4>Episode 2 - Amanda Newton</h4>
		<h5>Uploaded - March 19th 2017</h5>
		<br>
		<p>Welcome to the latest episode of ‘On the Couch with M&amp;M.’</p>
		<br>
		<p>In today’s interview, we find out why Amanda Newton, Director of the award-winning accountancy practice, Negotiis Accounting in Point Cook Melbourne, would venture into the world of real estate. This is a fascinating story of how after listening to their client’s challenges and disappointments with their external real estate transactions, inspired Negotiis to create a new generation of real estate service delivery.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Combining their award winning formula used in their accountancy firm and financial expertise, they hope to bring that same personal high touch experience through their soon to launch real estate division, Negotiis Property. This will certainly be a ‘watch this space’ journey.</p>
